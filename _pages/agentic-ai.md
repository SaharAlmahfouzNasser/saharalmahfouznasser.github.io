### Summary
This week our team dug into **AutoGen**, a framework for building multi-agent LLM systems where “conversable” agents (LLMs, tools, and humans) solve tasks together via conversation programming.

- **Plain terms:** Assign roles — *researcher, coder, validator* — and let them collaborate (with humans in the loop) to reach safer, more reliable outcomes. 🧠🤝  
- **Oncology angle — why we care 🧬**
  - **Novel biomarkers:** role-split retrieval, coding, and safety checks speed exploratory analyses without risking PHI. 🔍  
  - **Reproducible hypothesis validation:** “writer → safeguard → executor” loops test hypotheses, track provenance, and cut error cascades. 📊  
  - **Human-in-the-loop by design:** clinicians and researchers step in at decision points for oversight and accountability. 👩‍⚕️👨‍💻

### Open Questions for the Community
- **Privacy:** on-prem deployments, differential privacy, synthetic data. 🔒  
- **Safety & evaluation:** benchmark datasets/metrics for agent pipelines. 🛡️  
- **Alternatives / complements:** what’s worked for you (e.g., LangGraph, CrewAI, Transformers Agents) in regulated settings? ⚙️

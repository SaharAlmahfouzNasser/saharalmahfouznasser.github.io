<h1>About Me</h1>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  I am a postdoctoral researcher in the 
  <a href="https://med.emory.edu/research/research-innovation/hsrbii/index.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Department of Biomedical Engineering</a> 
  at Emory University, working with 
  <a href="https://winshipcancer.emory.edu/profiles/madabhushi-anant.php" style="text-decoration: none;">Dr. Anant Madabhushi</a> 
  on computational pathology and AI for precision oncology. My expertise spans machine learning, computer vision, and medical image analysis, with publications in venues such as WACV, MICCAI, ISBI, ASCO, JCO, and Ultrasonics.

<p></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  I completed my PhD at the 
  <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">Indian Institute of Technology Bombay</a>, guided by 
  <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Amit Sethi</a>, where I worked on cross-domain image adaptation and matching. My doctoral training combined digital signal processing and machine learning with precision medicine, conducted in close collaboration with clinicians at 
  <a href="https://tmc.gov.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">Tata Memorial Hospital</a>.

<p></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  At Emory, I have advanced robust mitosis detection models, explainable AI tools for HER2 scoring that outperform FDA-approved assays, and prognostic models for ER+/HER2− breast cancer. My recent work emphasizes agentic AI systems for oncology, including multi-agent frameworks for tumor microenvironment phenotyping, federated learning pipelines for secure collaboration, and hallucination-free image normalization across modalities.
</div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  My long-term vision is to develop explainable, generalizable, and equitable AI-driven biomarkers that personalize treatment decisions, reduce overtreatment, and make precision cancer care more accessible worldwide.

<br>I maintain a list of my publications under the Research tab and my full Resume is attached the CV Tab.

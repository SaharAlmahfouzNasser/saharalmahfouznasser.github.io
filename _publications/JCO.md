Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a transformative force in oncology, yet translation into real-world practice requires alignment with both clinician and patient priorities.  
In this perspective, we provide a dual-lens view: clinicians outline opportunities to improve diagnostics, prognostication, and treatment planning, while patients emphasize explainability, trust, and accessibility.  
Together, we propose strategies to responsibly integrate AI into oncology practice and ensure equitable benefit across populations.

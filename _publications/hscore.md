Accurate HER2 scoring is critical for guiding targeted therapy in breast cancer, yet manual estimation suffers from subjectivity and variability.  
We present **HAI-score**, an explainable and reproducible AI pipeline that quantifies HER2 H-scores directly from IHC-stained slides.  
Our method outperformed traditional assays and demonstrated strong correlation with clinical outcomes across multi-institutional cohorts.
